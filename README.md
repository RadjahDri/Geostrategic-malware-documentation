# Geostrategic-Malware-Documentation

This repository contains all the summary texts from http://malwaregenesis.eu

The point here is to find these texts separetely from the website if you want to download them or just don't want to load our full javascript website ! But also, we want to have many contributors to this repository that can provide more summary texts or complete ours. Note that every summary text will be verified by us before publication and that you can do them either in english or french, as you want.

A form will be available on our website later, in the meantime , please respect the following instructions and for the moment don't bother about the excel file, we will fill it up.

**To create a new summary text, respect exactly the template in en/Template.md please, or our parser won't work.**
