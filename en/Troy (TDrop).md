### Context
Even if the estimated date for the beginning of this operation named "Operation Troy" was in early 2009, it is only the 20th march 2013 
that this spying operation is brought to light. These attacks, that can be called "Dark Seoul" attacks, are at this time generating a big buzz on a World scale.
Since 2009, approximately 18 malwares were used to retrieve informations on South Korea.
This campaign, assigned to the North Korea, appears to be another side of the existing tensions between these two neighboring countries.
During these four spying years, different targets will be the victims of these malwares.
It goes from the military sector to the financial institutions, and even the medias and administrations.
In this summary text we will only talk about the operation that started in March 2013.
In this spying and sabotaging campaign, the targets are the strategical sectors of the South Korea.
The banks that were hit by these malwares were quite disturbed considering that work computers from many employees became ineffectives.
The medias were also the targets of the same actions.
Furthermore, simultaneously, some of their websites were defaced.
This new operation follows on the threats from the North Korean leader.
On 7th march 2013, he announces that he wants to bomb South Korea.
By doing this, he also wants to alert the USA that supports South Korea.
These threats are renewing the tensions in the Korean peninsula.
