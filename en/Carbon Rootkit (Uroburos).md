### Date
2011
### Context
Uroburos, aka Carbon Rootkit, Snake, TulaCobra or Sun Rootkit, was designed to "steal confidential data". Those who hide behind Ouroburos are the same than those who led a cyber attack against the USA in 2008 with Agent.BTZ, which was Russia. Their objective was to check the presence of the malware Agent.BTZ, and to steal confidential data. If Agent.BTZ was not in the system, Uruburos would stay inactive. Agent.BTZ was used in 2008 in the attack of the pentagone by Russia. 
### Propagation
Spear Phishing, USB
