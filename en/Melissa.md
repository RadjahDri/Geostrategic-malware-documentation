## Appearance
### Date
26/03/1999
### Context
Created in loving memory of a topless dancer in Florida
### Propagation
Phishing (Attached in emails)
## Impacts
### Purposes
Created as a challenge.
### Exploitation
Phishing : if an user open the .doc document (enclosed in an email), a macro activating the malware is executed (if macros are enabled). The virus infects the "Normal.doc" template of Microsoft Word (this template is the default template and therefore always exists), and thus infects all the documents using this template. The malware then tries to self replicate by sending the document by email to the 50 first contacts inside every Microsoft Oulook MAPI available to the infected user. Sometimes, the malware edits documents by inserting a quote from "The Simpsons".
### Targets
#### Entities
Corporations
#### Systems
Windows OS with Microsoft Word 97 or 2000 installed
### Reaction
Detection, communication and malware analysis
### Targeted countries
Mostly American's corporations (Microsoft, Intel, Lucent Technologies...)
### Damage caused and cost
The document from the infected user can be used for propagation instead of the original document and thus led to the propagation of sensistive information. A collateral effect of this malware is a denial of service on mail servers. 
Estimated cost : more than 80 million dollars.
