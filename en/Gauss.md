## Other features
- The main module of the malware has been choose in reference to the famous mathematician and each module is named with names of famous personnage (Godel, Lagrange, Tailor).
- Several hints shows that Gauss comes from Flame. Its structure is very modular like Flame and a part of code is the same. Another indicator of the link with Flame is a the vulnerability exploited by Gauss (MS10-046). Moreover the last similarity is how works Gauss, which is very like to Flame. In the code a path, "settings\\flamer\\desktop\\gauss_white_1", was found in comments.
