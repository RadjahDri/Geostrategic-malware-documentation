#### Operation Hong Kong
The tensions between China and Hong Kong were high when this malware was used. China wanted to assert its autority on Hong Kong which does not intend to give in easily. Honk Kong doesn't want the communism China enforces and want to maintain the current principle of "one country, two systems". In 2017, new elections for the position of "Chief Executive" should see the arisen of new tensions between China and its Special Administrative Region. 
#### Operation Molerats
From the start of the 20th Century, the Middle East is a geographic zone where many conflicts arose, either religious or ethnicals. It is also a strategic area for the USA or Russia. Many oil wells are located in the area, as well as the Suez Canal which is highly used for maritime transport.
### Propagation
First available on the internet, it infects computers by mail phishing through Word or PDF attachments. Evolved versions have been spreaded through a self extractable RAR file. That RAR file contained 3 files : a legitimate executable program, en encoded shellcode and a DLL which loaded the shellcode into the program.

## Other features
This malware was created in 2005. It was mainly for the use of "script kiddies" because it was easaly downloadable and usable without major modifications. A Graphical User Interface was also available to manage the different infected hosts by the RAT. However, each state group that used this malware appropriated it and modified it. 
Free detections tools were developped by FireEye. 
### Operation Nitro 
The chemical industries targeted by Poison Ivy were in the same time also victims of cyber attacks from another origin. 
### Operation Molerats
Another RAT, XtremRAT is also part of the same campaign.
