### Context
The annoncement of the movie "The Interview", a comedy about the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, is the triggerr factor of this cyber attack. Some hacktivists didn't like the movie and showed it by atatcking Sony Pictures Entertainment. This operation was claimed by the "Guardians of Peace" group, but by linking this attack with pre existing ones, it seems the real group behind this attack is Lazarus. "Guardians of Peace" claimed to have stolen a large quantity of information on Sony's servers, and asked for money in the first place, before asking Sony not to broadcast the movie. The Hollywoodian studio first complied, before announcing a release of the movie in a limited number of cinemas. Sanctions on North Korea followed the 2nd of January 2015. These sanctions target the north korean intelligence organisations and some weapons dealers.
